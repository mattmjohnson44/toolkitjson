We shaped a first version that was just functional enough to use ourselves. We didn’t expect to ship it to customers without doing an additional cycle on it. This was a risk: we bet one cycle, not two. If it didn’t work out, we’d scrap it. If something more important came up, we might not ever schedule the second cycle.

2-3 months of time to ramp up, assuming 2-3 hours per day is being spent on it.\n\n#### Customer & User Knowledge\n\nBeyond visiting customers….\n\n\n- Your team (engineering & design leads)\n- Start with the user research team, if there is one\n- Then the customer success / service team\n  - Learn who their fav customers are, their least fav, and why\n  - Understand more about how customers perceive your product.\n  - Learn what they can teach you about your users and customers\n- Product Marketing has a valuable perspective on users and also good insights into the broader sales and marketing divisions and who you should talk to in there\n- Founders / CEO\n  - Which customers they consider the most helpful for you to truly get to know and understand. Not just happy, but unhappy too… you’re after as many perspectives as you can get.\n- At this point you’re able to go out and meeting real users and customers.\n  - Marty recommends at least 15 customer visits as part of new PM onboarding.\n\n####Data knowledge\n\nUser analytics: How users interact with your product\nSales analytics: The sales cycle for your product\nData warehouse analytics: How this data is changing over time\n\n_The idea is to attain competence with each of these tools which means two things:_\n\n- You know how to answer questions with that tool\n- You need to understand what the data in the tool is trying to tell you.\n\n####Industry and domain knowledge\n\nKey to industry knowledge is identifying which industry trends are expected to be relevant to the pM’s product.\n\n- The first step is to identify the trends, and there may be some education needed to understand what the trend or technology enables and what the capabilities and limitations may be.\n- Also included is competitive analysis. Product marketing is a good place to get started, but the PM will need to have a deeper understanding of the offerings, vision and strategy of each of the major players in the landscape\n  - Marty’s approach is to ask the PM to evaluate the top three to give players in the pace and write up a narrative comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of each player - i.e. highlighting opportunities\n\n#### Business and Company knowledge\n\nAn essential difference between competent and incompetent PMs.\n\n- Have the new PM fill out a business model canvas for their product. It is a quick and easy way to help the PM quickly realise the areas they might not understand.\n\n#### Sales & Marketing - Go-to-market\n\nThe go-to-market strategy describes how our product makes it into the hands of users and customers. It applies to every product.\n\nI.e. direct sales force, resellers, directly over the web. Etc.\n\nThe sales process starts with marketing which itself has many different strategies and techniques. Ultimately there is always some type of funnel starting with people becoming aware you exist, and hopefully through to active customer.\n\n- The new PM needs to understand the entire funnel from awareness, to trials and to onboarding.\n- It’s especially important to understand the capabilities and limitations of the sales channel. \n\n####Finance - Revenue and costs.\n\n- Marty advocates making a friend in finance for this purpose. There are financial related KPIs for every product and you need to understand:\n  - What those KPIs are (e.g. lifetime value of the customer\n  - What they mean \n  - Where your product stands… e.g. is lifetime value sufficient compared to your CAC (LTV / CAC)\n\n####Privacy and Compliance \n\nPrivacy, security, compliance, ethics. Make a friend in legal who can help the new PM understand legal constraints.\n\n####Biz dev & partnerships\n\nAgreements with tech partners, marketing partners etc, usually come along with constraints about what we can do, it’s important to understand these.\n\n\n","id":"615bb7740b3a006cb0959185","name":"Acquiring Product Knowledge (An onboarding plan of sorts)","idShort":232,"shortLink":"zzOSC2Ao"},"old":{"desc":"Requires 2-3 months of time to ramp up, assuming 2-3 hours per day is being spent on it.\n\n#### Customer & User Knowledge\n\nBeyond visiting customers….\n\n\n- Your team (engineering & design leads)\n- Start with the user research team, if there is one\n- Then the customer success / service team\n  - Learn who their fav customers are, their least fav, and why\n  - Understand more about how customers perceive your product.\n  - Learn what they can teach you about your users and customers\n- Product Marketing has a valuable perspective on users and also good insights into the broader sales and marketing divisions and who you should talk to in there\n- Founders / CEO\n  - Which customers they consider the most helpful for you to truly get to know and understand.

Add it as it is implied by the other two opportunities.","id":"61511bf1da7c792690264fa0","name":"OST structure: Parents & Siblings","idShort":172,"shortLink":"TvhkvJot"},"board":{"id":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","name":"Product Toolkit","shortLink":"ImvDsFXp"},"list":{"id":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","name":"Continuous Discovery"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2021-09-27T01:51:26.537Z","appCreator":null,"limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","fullName":"Matt","idMemberReferrer":"520dd1dfa9e551e268001694","initials":"M","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Matt","initials":"M","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"mattmjohnson"}},{"id":"61512191273d463840da272d","idMemberCreator":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","data":{"old":{"desc":""},"card":{"desc":"Review your interview snapshots and for each opportunity ask the following questions:\n\n1.

But that’s going to take time and I want you to have it today.\n\nSo I’m going to scratch the surface in this blog post.\n\nI suspect you are going to have one of two reactions. You will either skim this post, conclude it’s obvious and that you already do it, and miss the point entirely. Or you will be left wanting more.\n\nFor those in the first camp, I encourage you to slow down. To look for what’s new here and to give it a try. I’ve been coaching product teams for three years on modern product discovery and this single change has had a bigger impact on how teams work than everything else I do with them combined.\n\nFor those of you in the latter camp who will be left wanting more, I’m writing as fast as I can. I hope to have the book ready by early 2017 and I’ll be blogging bits and pieces along the way.\n\nLet’s get on with it. Please humor me, as this is going to take some setup.\n\nIt all started a few months ago…\n\nThe Messy Challenge of Modern Product Discovery\nSeveral teams within a week or two of each other started telling me that while they were learning a lot in our sessions together, they were struggling to see the big picture.\n\nWe would jump from reviewing interview guides one week to discussing experiment results the next.\n\nEach piece in its own right was helpful, but the teams weren’t learning how to string it together on their own. I always had to tell them what to do next.\n\nMy goal as a coach is to get teams doing continuous discovery on their own as quickly as possible. So I knew something had to change.\n\nI kept asking myself, how do I decide what comes next? And more importantly, how do I teach this to teams?\n\nI started by trying to be more explicit about what modern product discovery is. That led to this video.\n\nBut that didn’t entirely solve the problem.\n\nIt’s easy for teams to work along both dimensions of product discovery—working to understand their customer’s context and iteratively testing their ideas—but that doesn’t mean they know how to connect the two sets of activities.\n\nOver time, I started to reframe the two dimensions as discovering opportunities and discovering solutions.\n\nGood product discovery requires discovering opportunities as well as discovering solutions. – Tweet This\n\nThis helped as most teams can articulate how to connect the dots between opportunities and solutions. But they didn’t necessarily do so in practice.\n\nI still saw teams entertaining solutions that weren’t connected to the opportunities they were finding through generative research.\n\nFortunately, around this time I was reading Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson.\n\nEricsson has spent his career studying what makes experts stand apart from novices and Peak summarizes his perspective on the research today.\n\nIt gave me a lot of food for thought about how we develop expertise in product discovery.\n\nHis chapter on the role of mental representations in expert performance is what led to my breakthrough.\n\nThe Power of Mental Representations\nEricsson argues that better mental representations are what set experts apart from novices.\n\nBetter mental representations set experts apart from novices. – Tweet This\n\nHe defines a mental representation as a “mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about.”\n\nThat might be a little too vague for those of us who aren’t cognitive scientists. He further explains:\n\n“… these representations are preexisting patterns of information—facts, images, rules, relationships, and so on—that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations.”\n\nIt’s this latter part of his definition that most intrigues me. If we develop better mental representations, we’ll be able to respond more quickly and effectively.\n\nMuch of Ericsson’s work compared novices to grandmaster chess players. In one study, he showed both novices and grandmasters a chessboard that represented a game midway through play.\n\nTo the novices the chessboard looked as if the board was set up at random. But to the grandmasters, they were able to understand what moves led to this position and were able to cycle through next moves and their potential outcomes. They were better able to predict which player might win the game.\n\nIn fact, as a result of studies like these, Ericsson concluded:\n\n“… that the advantage better players had in predicting future events was related to their ability to envision more possible outcomes and quickly sift through them and come up with the most promising action.”\n\nThe grandmasters relied on stronger mental representations of chess games to consider more possibilities.\n\nEricsson further explains:\n\n“… the key benefit of mental representations lies in how they help us deal with information: understanding and interpreting it, holding it in memory, organizing it, analyzing it, and making decisions with it.”\n\nBut it’s not just grandmaster chess players who have this advantage.\n\n“The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performance.”\n\nThis raises the question, is there a superior way of organizing information about product discovery that allows us to move quickly and more effectively?\n\nI believe there is.\n\nThe Mental Representations of Expert Product Managers\nI started to wonder if I relied on a mental representation to decide what to do next.\n\nIf I did, perhaps I could externalize it and use it to guide teams.\n\nMy theory was that over time, they would learn to adopt the same mental representation and become self-sufficient.\n\nMore importantly, I started to wonder if I could find evidence in the world of a shared mental representation used by many experts.\n\nPerhaps this could be the key to teaching product discovery.\n\nAre expert mental representations the key to teaching product discovery? – Tweet This\n\nThis line of inquiry reminded me of Bernie Roth. Bernie is a Professor of Engineering and the Academic Director at the d.school at Stanford University.\n\nI met Bernie at a design event hosted by the Stanford Alumni Association. He led a session that stood out to me.\n\nHe asked attendees to identify something that they wanted in their life. He gave a few examples, a house, a better job, more leisure time.\n\nHe gave us a minute to write down our answers. Then he asked us another question. He said, “If you had whatever you wrote down today, what would that do for you?”\n\nFor example, if you had a house today or a better job today, why would you be better off?\n\nThis was a powerful question.\n\nHe explained why by extending his example. If you wrote down that you wanted a house, you might have answered the second question with something along the lines of, “If I had a house today, I would feel more grounded in my community.”\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node and buying a house with two unknown ideas as children\nHow else might you feel grounded in your community?\n\nHe then used this next answer to ask an even more powerful question.\n\n“How else might you feel more grounded in your community?”\n\nThis final question is powerful because it disrupts our fixation on a single solution—owning a house—and helps us to think expansively about other ways we might get the same benefit—feeling grounded in our community.\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node with children buy a house, join social club, and volunteer.\nBernie teaches a simple structure for expanding your options.\n\nFor example, we might become more active in our church community or with a social club. We might volunteer at our children’s schools or start attending neighborhood events.\n\nBernie taught a very simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution.\n\nLearn a simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution. – Tweet This\n\nI had never seen reframing taught so simply and so effectively.\n\nBut there’s more power behind this exercise. Through his teaching, Bernie is revealing his own mental representation for how he solves open-ended problems.\n\nProduct Managers are Problem Solvers\nBernie isn’t the only expert to expose this mental representation.\n\nIf we widen our own lens from the world of product management to the world of problem solving—remember, product managers are problem solvers—we see this mental representation show up again and again.\n\nIf you’ve been reading Product Talk since the beginning of the year, you might remember David Jonassen’s work on problem solving. See this article.\n\nJonassen argues that ill-structured problems are problems that have many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. The solver must start by defining the goal and constraints of the problem before exploring potential solutions.\n\nI argued in this article that the hard problems that product managers face are ill-structured and borrowed from Jonassen’s model for solving ill-structured problems.\n\nThe short of it is that the problem solver, in our case, the product manager (or even better, the product team), must start by framing the problem.\n\nThis is exactly what Bernie is doing with his powerful questions. He helped us uncover the implicit framing of the problem (feeling grounded in our community) behind our desired solution (buying a house).\n\nBy making the problem framing explicit, Bernie shows us how we can question it (reframing) and use it to generate alternative solutions (multitracking).\n\nMake your problem framing explicit. So you can both question it and use it to generate more solutions. – Tweet This\n\nMultitracking should sound familiar to long-time readers as well.\n\nChip and Dan Heath talk about the value of multitracking in their book Decisive—a summary of the research on decision making. I’ve written twelve blog posts about this book—you can find them here.\n\nBut Bernie’s exercise is about more than multitracking. He’s multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nHis first question, “What would you have if you had that?” creates a structure between “I want a house” and “I want to feel grounded in my community.”\n\nHis second question, “How else can you feel grounded in your community?”, expands that structure.\n\nThis systematic approach is important. Remember, John Dewey in How We Think, encourages us “to maintain the state of doubt and to carry on a systematic and protracted inquiry—these are the essentials of thinking.”\n\nBernie’s simple example is starting to give us a window into how expert problem solvers use framing to support multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nAnd as Ericsson argued, they are relying on better mental representations to help them do so.\n\n4 Common Gaps in Our Thinking Today\nLet’s start to translate all of this to the world of product management.\n\nGap #1: We don’t examine our ideas before investing in them.\nBernie asked us, “What do we want in our lives?” As product managers we ask, “What should we build next?”\n\nIn both cases, what follows is an idea. Maybe two or three, if we are lucky.\n\nLet’s use a product example to illustrate this. Imagine you work at Facebook and you are responsible for newsfeed stories.\n\nYou might answer the question, “What should we build next?” with an idea, “Let’s add a dislike button.”\n\nSome of us rush off and build that first idea or two. That’s akin to rushing off and buying a house before examining why we want one.\n\nGaps in our thinking #1: We don’t examine our ideas before investing in them. – Tweet This\n\nGap #2: We don’t consider enough ideas.\nSome of us might slow down and examine our thinking.

But that’s going to take time and I want you to have it today.\n\nSo I’m going to scratch the surface in this blog post.\n\nI suspect you are going to have one of two reactions. You will either skim this post, conclude it’s obvious and that you already do it, and miss the point entirely. Or you will be left wanting more.\n\nFor those in the first camp, I encourage you to slow down. To look for what’s new here and to give it a try. I’ve been coaching product teams for three years on modern product discovery and this single change has had a bigger impact on how teams work than everything else I do with them combined.\n\nFor those of you in the latter camp who will be left wanting more, I’m writing as fast as I can. I hope to have the book ready by early 2017 and I’ll be blogging bits and pieces along the way.\n\nLet’s get on with it. Please humor me, as this is going to take some setup.\n\nIt all started a few months ago…\n\nThe Messy Challenge of Modern Product Discovery\nSeveral teams within a week or two of each other started telling me that while they were learning a lot in our sessions together, they were struggling to see the big picture.\n\nWe would jump from reviewing interview guides one week to discussing experiment results the next.\n\nEach piece in its own right was helpful, but the teams weren’t learning how to string it together on their own. I always had to tell them what to do next.\n\nMy goal as a coach is to get teams doing continuous discovery on their own as quickly as possible. So I knew something had to change.\n\nI kept asking myself, how do I decide what comes next? And more importantly, how do I teach this to teams?\n\nI started by trying to be more explicit about what modern product discovery is. That led to this video.\n\nBut that didn’t entirely solve the problem.\n\nIt’s easy for teams to work along both dimensions of product discovery—working to understand their customer’s context and iteratively testing their ideas—but that doesn’t mean they know how to connect the two sets of activities.\n\nOver time, I started to reframe the two dimensions as discovering opportunities and discovering solutions.\n\nGood product discovery requires discovering opportunities as well as discovering solutions. – Tweet This\n\nThis helped as most teams can articulate how to connect the dots between opportunities and solutions. But they didn’t necessarily do so in practice.\n\nI still saw teams entertaining solutions that weren’t connected to the opportunities they were finding through generative research.\n\nFortunately, around this time I was reading Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson.\n\nEricsson has spent his career studying what makes experts stand apart from novices and Peak summarizes his perspective on the research today.\n\nIt gave me a lot of food for thought about how we develop expertise in product discovery.\n\nHis chapter on the role of mental representations in expert performance is what led to my breakthrough.\n\nThe Power of Mental Representations\nEricsson argues that better mental representations are what set experts apart from novices.\n\nBetter mental representations set experts apart from novices. – Tweet This\n\nHe defines a mental representation as a “mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about.”\n\nThat might be a little too vague for those of us who aren’t cognitive scientists. He further explains:\n\n“… these representations are preexisting patterns of information—facts, images, rules, relationships, and so on—that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations.”\n\nIt’s this latter part of his definition that most intrigues me. If we develop better mental representations, we’ll be able to respond more quickly and effectively.\n\nMuch of Ericsson’s work compared novices to grandmaster chess players. In one study, he showed both novices and grandmasters a chessboard that represented a game midway through play.\n\nTo the novices the chessboard looked as if the board was set up at random. But to the grandmasters, they were able to understand what moves led to this position and were able to cycle through next moves and their potential outcomes. They were better able to predict which player might win the game.\n\nIn fact, as a result of studies like these, Ericsson concluded:\n\n“… that the advantage better players had in predicting future events was related to their ability to envision more possible outcomes and quickly sift through them and come up with the most promising action.”\n\nThe grandmasters relied on stronger mental representations of chess games to consider more possibilities.\n\nEricsson further explains:\n\n“… the key benefit of mental representations lies in how they help us deal with information: understanding and interpreting it, holding it in memory, organizing it, analyzing it, and making decisions with it.”\n\nBut it’s not just grandmaster chess players who have this advantage.\n\n“The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performance.”\n\nThis raises the question, is there a superior way of organizing information about product discovery that allows us to move quickly and more effectively?\n\nI believe there is.\n\nThe Mental Representations of Expert Product Managers\nI started to wonder if I relied on a mental representation to decide what to do next.\n\nIf I did, perhaps I could externalize it and use it to guide teams.\n\nMy theory was that over time, they would learn to adopt the same mental representation and become self-sufficient.\n\nMore importantly, I started to wonder if I could find evidence in the world of a shared mental representation used by many experts.\n\nPerhaps this could be the key to teaching product discovery.\n\nAre expert mental representations the key to teaching product discovery? – Tweet This\n\nThis line of inquiry reminded me of Bernie Roth. Bernie is a Professor of Engineering and the Academic Director at the d.school at Stanford University.\n\nI met Bernie at a design event hosted by the Stanford Alumni Association. He led a session that stood out to me.\n\nHe asked attendees to identify something that they wanted in their life. He gave a few examples, a house, a better job, more leisure time.\n\nHe gave us a minute to write down our answers. Then he asked us another question. He said, “If you had whatever you wrote down today, what would that do for you?”\n\nFor example, if you had a house today or a better job today, why would you be better off?\n\nThis was a powerful question.\n\nHe explained why by extending his example. If you wrote down that you wanted a house, you might have answered the second question with something along the lines of, “If I had a house today, I would feel more grounded in my community.”\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node and buying a house with two unknown ideas as children\nHow else might you feel grounded in your community?\n\nHe then used this next answer to ask an even more powerful question.\n\n“How else might you feel more grounded in your community?”\n\nThis final question is powerful because it disrupts our fixation on a single solution—owning a house—and helps us to think expansively about other ways we might get the same benefit—feeling grounded in our community.\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node with children buy a house, join social club, and volunteer.\nBernie teaches a simple structure for expanding your options.\n\nFor example, we might become more active in our church community or with a social club. We might volunteer at our children’s schools or start attending neighborhood events.\n\nBernie taught a very simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution.\n\nLearn a simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution. – Tweet This\n\nI had never seen reframing taught so simply and so effectively.\n\nBut there’s more power behind this exercise. Through his teaching, Bernie is revealing his own mental representation for how he solves open-ended problems.\n\nProduct Managers are Problem Solvers\nBernie isn’t the only expert to expose this mental representation.\n\nIf we widen our own lens from the world of product management to the world of problem solving—remember, product managers are problem solvers—we see this mental representation show up again and again.\n\nIf you’ve been reading Product Talk since the beginning of the year, you might remember David Jonassen’s work on problem solving. See this article.\n\nJonassen argues that ill-structured problems are problems that have many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. The solver must start by defining the goal and constraints of the problem before exploring potential solutions.\n\nI argued in this article that the hard problems that product managers face are ill-structured and borrowed from Jonassen’s model for solving ill-structured problems.\n\nThe short of it is that the problem solver, in our case, the product manager (or even better, the product team), must start by framing the problem.\n\nThis is exactly what Bernie is doing with his powerful questions. He helped us uncover the implicit framing of the problem (feeling grounded in our community) behind our desired solution (buying a house).\n\nBy making the problem framing explicit, Bernie shows us how we can question it (reframing) and use it to generate alternative solutions (multitracking).\n\nMake your problem framing explicit. So you can both question it and use it to generate more solutions. – Tweet This\n\nMultitracking should sound familiar to long-time readers as well.\n\nChip and Dan Heath talk about the value of multitracking in their book Decisive—a summary of the research on decision making. I’ve written twelve blog posts about this book—you can find them here.\n\nBut Bernie’s exercise is about more than multitracking. He’s multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nHis first question, “What would you have if you had that?” creates a structure between “I want a house” and “I want to feel grounded in my community.”\n\nHis second question, “How else can you feel grounded in your community?”, expands that structure.\n\nThis systematic approach is important. Remember, John Dewey in How We Think, encourages us “to maintain the state of doubt and to carry on a systematic and protracted inquiry—these are the essentials of thinking.”\n\nBernie’s simple example is starting to give us a window into how expert problem solvers use framing to support multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nAnd as Ericsson argued, they are relying on better mental representations to help them do so.\n\n4 Common Gaps in Our Thinking Today\nLet’s start to translate all of this to the world of product management.\n\nGap #1: We don’t examine our ideas before investing in them.\nBernie asked us, “What do we want in our lives?” As product managers we ask, “What should we build next?”\n\nIn both cases, what follows is an idea. Maybe two or three, if we are lucky.\n\nLet’s use a product example to illustrate this. Imagine you work at Facebook and you are responsible for newsfeed stories.\n\nYou might answer the question, “What should we build next?” with an idea, “Let’s add a dislike button.”\n\nSome of us rush off and build that first idea or two.

But that’s going to take time and I want you to have it today.\n\nSo I’m going to scratch the surface in this blog post.\n\nI suspect you are going to have one of two reactions. You will either skim this post, conclude it’s obvious and that you already do it, and miss the point entirely. Or you will be left wanting more.\n\nFor those in the first camp, I encourage you to slow down. To look for what’s new here and to give it a try. I’ve been coaching product teams for three years on modern product discovery and this single change has had a bigger impact on how teams work than everything else I do with them combined.\n\nFor those of you in the latter camp who will be left wanting more, I’m writing as fast as I can. I hope to have the book ready by early 2017 and I’ll be blogging bits and pieces along the way.\n\nLet’s get on with it. Please humor me, as this is going to take some setup.\n\nIt all started a few months ago…\n\nThe Messy Challenge of Modern Product Discovery\nSeveral teams within a week or two of each other started telling me that while they were learning a lot in our sessions together, they were struggling to see the big picture.\n\nWe would jump from reviewing interview guides one week to discussing experiment results the next.\n\nEach piece in its own right was helpful, but the teams weren’t learning how to string it together on their own. I always had to tell them what to do next.\n\nMy goal as a coach is to get teams doing continuous discovery on their own as quickly as possible. So I knew something had to change.\n\nI kept asking myself, how do I decide what comes next? And more importantly, how do I teach this to teams?\n\nI started by trying to be more explicit about what modern product discovery is. That led to this video.\n\nBut that didn’t entirely solve the problem.\n\nIt’s easy for teams to work along both dimensions of product discovery—working to understand their customer’s context and iteratively testing their ideas—but that doesn’t mean they know how to connect the two sets of activities.\n\nOver time, I started to reframe the two dimensions as discovering opportunities and discovering solutions.\n\nGood product discovery requires discovering opportunities as well as discovering solutions. – Tweet This\n\nThis helped as most teams can articulate how to connect the dots between opportunities and solutions. But they didn’t necessarily do so in practice.\n\nI still saw teams entertaining solutions that weren’t connected to the opportunities they were finding through generative research.\n\nFortunately, around this time I was reading Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson.\n\nEricsson has spent his career studying what makes experts stand apart from novices and Peak summarizes his perspective on the research today.\n\nIt gave me a lot of food for thought about how we develop expertise in product discovery.\n\nHis chapter on the role of mental representations in expert performance is what led to my breakthrough.\n\nThe Power of Mental Representations\nEricsson argues that better mental representations are what set experts apart from novices.\n\nBetter mental representations set experts apart from novices. – Tweet This\n\nHe defines a mental representation as a “mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about.”\n\nThat might be a little too vague for those of us who aren’t cognitive scientists. He further explains:\n\n“… these representations are preexisting patterns of information—facts, images, rules, relationships, and so on—that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations.”\n\nIt’s this latter part of his definition that most intrigues me. If we develop better mental representations, we’ll be able to respond more quickly and effectively.\n\nMuch of Ericsson’s work compared novices to grandmaster chess players. In one study, he showed both novices and grandmasters a chessboard that represented a game midway through play.\n\nTo the novices the chessboard looked as if the board was set up at random. But to the grandmasters, they were able to understand what moves led to this position and were able to cycle through next moves and their potential outcomes. They were better able to predict which player might win the game.\n\nIn fact, as a result of studies like these, Ericsson concluded:\n\n“… that the advantage better players had in predicting future events was related to their ability to envision more possible outcomes and quickly sift through them and come up with the most promising action.”\n\nThe grandmasters relied on stronger mental representations of chess games to consider more possibilities.\n\nEricsson further explains:\n\n“… the key benefit of mental representations lies in how they help us deal with information: understanding and interpreting it, holding it in memory, organizing it, analyzing it, and making decisions with it.”\n\nBut it’s not just grandmaster chess players who have this advantage.\n\n“The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performance.”\n\nThis raises the question, is there a superior way of organizing information about product discovery that allows us to move quickly and more effectively?\n\nI believe there is.\n\nThe Mental Representations of Expert Product Managers\nI started to wonder if I relied on a mental representation to decide what to do next.\n\nIf I did, perhaps I could externalize it and use it to guide teams.\n\nMy theory was that over time, they would learn to adopt the same mental representation and become self-sufficient.\n\nMore importantly, I started to wonder if I could find evidence in the world of a shared mental representation used by many experts.\n\nPerhaps this could be the key to teaching product discovery.\n\nAre expert mental representations the key to teaching product discovery? – Tweet This\n\nThis line of inquiry reminded me of Bernie Roth. Bernie is a Professor of Engineering and the Academic Director at the d.school at Stanford University.\n\nI met Bernie at a design event hosted by the Stanford Alumni Association. He led a session that stood out to me.\n\nHe asked attendees to identify something that they wanted in their life. He gave a few examples, a house, a better job, more leisure time.\n\nHe gave us a minute to write down our answers. Then he asked us another question. He said, “If you had whatever you wrote down today, what would that do for you?”\n\nFor example, if you had a house today or a better job today, why would you be better off?\n\nThis was a powerful question.\n\nHe explained why by extending his example. If you wrote down that you wanted a house, you might have answered the second question with something along the lines of, “If I had a house today, I would feel more grounded in my community.”\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node and buying a house with two unknown ideas as children\nHow else might you feel grounded in your community?\n\nHe then used this next answer to ask an even more powerful question.\n\n“How else might you feel more grounded in your community?”\n\nThis final question is powerful because it disrupts our fixation on a single solution—owning a house—and helps us to think expansively about other ways we might get the same benefit—feeling grounded in our community.\n\nTree chart with feeling grounded in your community as the root node with children buy a house, join social club, and volunteer.\nBernie teaches a simple structure for expanding your options.\n\nFor example, we might become more active in our church community or with a social club. We might volunteer at our children’s schools or start attending neighborhood events.\n\nBernie taught a very simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution.\n\nLearn a simple way to widen your lens, to avoid fixating on a single solution. – Tweet This\n\nI had never seen reframing taught so simply and so effectively.\n\nBut there’s more power behind this exercise. Through his teaching, Bernie is revealing his own mental representation for how he solves open-ended problems.\n\nProduct Managers are Problem Solvers\nBernie isn’t the only expert to expose this mental representation.\n\nIf we widen our own lens from the world of product management to the world of problem solving—remember, product managers are problem solvers—we see this mental representation show up again and again.\n\nIf you’ve been reading Product Talk since the beginning of the year, you might remember David Jonassen’s work on problem solving. See this article.\n\nJonassen argues that ill-structured problems are problems that have many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. The solver must start by defining the goal and constraints of the problem before exploring potential solutions.\n\nI argued in this article that the hard problems that product managers face are ill-structured and borrowed from Jonassen’s model for solving ill-structured problems.\n\nThe short of it is that the problem solver, in our case, the product manager (or even better, the product team), must start by framing the problem.\n\nThis is exactly what Bernie is doing with his powerful questions. He helped us uncover the implicit framing of the problem (feeling grounded in our community) behind our desired solution (buying a house).\n\nBy making the problem framing explicit, Bernie shows us how we can question it (reframing) and use it to generate alternative solutions (multitracking).\n\nMake your problem framing explicit. So you can both question it and use it to generate more solutions. – Tweet This\n\nMultitracking should sound familiar to long-time readers as well.\n\nChip and Dan Heath talk about the value of multitracking in their book Decisive—a summary of the research on decision making. I’ve written twelve blog posts about this book—you can find them here.\n\nBut Bernie’s exercise is about more than multitracking. He’s multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nHis first question, “What would you have if you had that?” creates a structure between “I want a house” and “I want to feel grounded in my community.”\n\nHis second question, “How else can you feel grounded in your community?”, expands that structure.\n\nThis systematic approach is important. Remember, John Dewey in How We Think, encourages us “to maintain the state of doubt and to carry on a systematic and protracted inquiry—these are the essentials of thinking.”\n\nBernie’s simple example is starting to give us a window into how expert problem solvers use framing to support multitracking in a systematic way.\n\nAnd as Ericsson argued, they are relying on better mental representations to help them do so.\n\n4 Common Gaps in Our Thinking Today\nLet’s start to translate all of this to the world of product management.\n\nGap #1: We don’t examine our ideas before investing in them.\nBernie asked us, “What do we want in our lives?” As product managers we ask, “What should we build next?”\n\nIn both cases, what follows is an idea. Maybe two or three, if we are lucky.\n\nLet’s use a product example to illustrate this. Imagine you work at Facebook and you are responsible for newsfeed stories.\n\nYou might answer the question, “What should we build next?” with an idea, “Let’s add a dislike button.”\n\nSome of us rush off and build that first idea or two. That’s akin to rushing off and buying a house before examining why we want one.\n\nGaps in our thinking #1: We don’t examine our ideas before investing in them. – Tweet This\n\nGap #2: We don’t consider enough ideas.\nSome of us might slow down and examine our thinking. We might ask, “Why do I think this idea is worth building?”\n\nMy idea will drive this desired outcome. Adding a dislike button will increase engagement.\nWe often justify our favorite solution by arguing it drives a desired outcome.\n\nWe often start with a single idea and work backwards to consider our desired outcome.\n\nReturning to our Facebook example, we might look at our idea and argue, building this idea will increase engagement on newsfeed stories.\n\nIn other words, the answer comes in the form of “My idea will drive some desired outcome.”\n\nIt sounds good.\n\nTree chart with Desired Outcome as the root and Idea A, and two unknown ideas as children.

That's ok. \n- Starting with a handful of KPIs (AKA key results) is a good and manageable place to land.\n\n-----\n\n**Contactually key results example**\n\nTying this back to Contactually’s objective of **“improve the feature sets of our existing plans so more users will purchase,”**\n\nkey results here could be \n\n- “an increase in user base by 5% over the course of a specific timeframe” (a quarter, year, etc.) \n\nand feature-specific metrics such as \n\n- “time to compose and send an email is reduced by 10%,” indicating that the usability of that part of the product has been improved. \n\n_Note that there can be multiple key results to each objective, as it may take different measures to determine whether an objective is met._\n\n--------\n\n**Caution on metrics**\n\n- Be aware of falling into the trap of measuring non-business metrics. i.e.:\n\n  - Feature metrics: Performance of a feature (How many people are using it? Is it quicker or easier for a customer to do X now than it was before?)\n\n  - Product metrics: Performance of specific product objectives (Because of feature X, more people are using functionality Y)\n\n  - Team metrics : How many story points/features were launched at the end of the month/quarter? (I put this in for dramatic effect; this will only lead to — at best — success theatre, and at worse, the wrong behaviours from all parties)\n\n^ these measures tell us very little about the business impact of all the work we've done. **Attached images** display a better example of tying key results to business objectives\n\nHEART framework is good for setting metrics:

Is it quicker or easier for a customer to do X now than it was before?)\n\n  - Product metrics: Performance of specific product objectives (Because of feature X, more people are using functionality Y)\n\n  - Team metrics : How many story points/features were launched at the end of the month/quarter? (I put this in for dramatic effect; this will only lead to — at best — success theatre, and at worse, the wrong behaviours from all parties)\n\n^ these measures tell us very little about the business impact of all the work we've done. **Attached images** display a better example of tying key results to business objectives\n\nHEART framework is good for setting metrics: https://www.dtelepathy.com/ux-metrics/#intro\n\n\n"},"old":{"desc":"> Identifying business objectives that tie to your vision is critical to making that vision a reality.

Values shape that ambiguous word thrown around company HR departments, culture — how people behave when no one is watching. Your organization’s values may inform your vision or mission, and how you go about achieving it.\n\n-----"},"old":{"desc":""}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-11-10T02:41:50.311Z","appCreator":null,"limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","fullName":"Matt","idMemberReferrer":"520dd1dfa9e551e268001694","initials":"M","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Matt","initials":"M","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"mattmjohnson"}},{"id":"5be6455e9206bc5eee121fa5","idMemberCreator":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","data":{"list":{"name":"Product Roadmapping","id":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09"},"board":{"shortLink":"ImvDsFXp","name":"Product Toolkit","id":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2"},"card":{"shortLink":"M3ztC2I4","idShort":29,"id":"5be6455988fff720bcdd3f14","name":"Defining a product vision"},"old":{"name":"Defingin a product vision"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-11-10T02:41:34.030Z","appCreator":null,"limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","fullName":"Matt","idMemberReferrer":"520dd1dfa9e551e268001694","initials":"M","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Matt","initials":"M","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"mattmjohnson"}},{"id":"5be6455988fff720bcdd3f15","idMemberCreator":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"ImvDsFXp","name":"Product Toolkit","id":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2"},"list":{"name":"Product Roadmapping","id":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09"},"card":{"shortLink":"M3ztC2I4","idShort":29,"name":"Defingin a product vision","id":"5be6455988fff720bcdd3f14"}},"type":"createCard","date":"2018-11-10T02:41:29.446Z","appCreator":null,"limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","fullName":"Matt","idMemberReferrer":"520dd1dfa9e551e268001694","initials":"M","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Matt","initials":"M","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"mattmjohnson"}},{"id":"5be64553d03cbb87c35973d0","idMemberCreator":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","data":{"list":{"name":"Product Roadmapping","id":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09"},"board":{"shortLink":"ImvDsFXp","name":"Product Toolkit","id":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2"},"card":{"shortLink":"wok73k9i","idShort":24,"name":"What is the purpose of a roadmap?

The study and application of prinicples, not methods, is what gives you the confidence to act in a complex world.\n\nJTBD thinking should be used to ground / reference the problems you are trying to solve, no matter the method you're using to try solve them\n\n> Upgrade your user, not your product. Don't build better cameras, build better photographers.\n\n^ ask yourself. How are we upgrading our user by doing this feature / initiative?\n\n^ How is feature / initiative delivering customers an ongoing feeling of emotional progress toward JTBD?\n\n**Applied to new features**\n\n- Before committing to develop a feature, make sure the problem intending to solve is one that customers actually have. To do so, find out if the customer had tried to solve the problem before.\n\n**Applied to competitive landscape**\n\n- What's the user's emotional motivation - use that to segment competition. Competitors will appeal to the same emotional aspiration (i.e. get me out of an entreprenurial slump with advice from someone I respect - conferences, linkedin, clarity)\n\n- From which budget will my product take away money? When they start using my produt, what will customers stop using?\n\n**On anxiety**\n\n- How does anxiety stop customers from buying a product? This should be viewed as a competitor.\n- Does the customer experience any anxiety in using the product? Find a way to make it less intimidating.\n\n\n**On habits**\n\n- Habits are a competitor to a product. Understand what habits users currently have, how can your product mimic / replace / enhance those whilst allowing the user to achieve progress.\n\n** on struggles**\n- Look for compensatory behaviour for examples of 'struggle' that can form product opportunities. i.e. are customers writing recipes on a list first? Using pinterest? Etc - user testing\n\n--------\n\n**Articulating a JTBD**\n\n- [Push, struggle, job] + [Pull, how life is better, jobs is done]\n--> Free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won't harm my children, so I can have more time to enjoy being a parent\n\n^ The most important test of JTBD wording is whether it also describes the solution it replaced."},"old":{"desc":"**Overall theory**\n\n> JTBD thinking is a principle, not a method. The study and application of prinicples, not methods, is what gives you the confidence to act in a complex world.\n\nJTBD thinking should be used to ground / reference the problems you are trying to solve, no matter the method you're using to try solve them\n\n> Upgrade your user, not your product. Don't build better cameras, build better photographers.\n\n^ ask yourself. How are we upgrading our user by doing this feature / initiative?\n\n^ How is feature / initiative delivering customers an ongoing feeling of emotional progress toward JTBD?\n\n**Applied to new features**\n\n- Before committing to develop a feature, make sure the problem intending to solve is one that customers actually have. To do so, find out if the customer had tried to solve the problem before.\n\n**Applied to competitive landscape**\n\n- What's the user's emotional motivation - use that to segment competition. Competitors will appeal to the same emotional aspiration (i.e. get me out of an entreprenurial slump with advice from someone I respect - conferences, linkedin, clarity)\n\n- From which budget will my product take away money? When they start using my produt, what will customers stop using?\n\n**On anxiety**\n\n- How does anxiety stop customers from buying a product? This should be viewed as a competitor.\n- Does the customer experience any anxiety in using the product? Find a way to make it less intimidating.\n\n\n**On habits**\n\n- Habits are a competitor to a product. Understand what habits users currently have, how can your product mimic / replace / enhance those whilst allowing the user to achieve progress.\n\n** on struggles**\n- Look for compensatory behaviour for examples of 'struggle' that can form product opportunities. i.e. are customers writing recipes on a list first? Using pinterest? Etc - user testing\n\n"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-11-08T03:44:26.011Z","appCreator":null,"limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","fullName":"Matt","idMemberReferrer":"520dd1dfa9e551e268001694","initials":"M","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Matt","initials":"M","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f/b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8","avatarHash":"b44bb2b780571ac81b70d82cb2a348a8"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"mattmjohnson"}},{"id":"5be3ad0674adf757f6583c6c","idMemberCreator":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","data":{"attachment":{"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/5be3abac48ce596dfb2dae89/attachments/5be3ad0674adf757f6583c6b/download/Screen_Shot_2018-11-08_at_2.15.04_pm.png","name":"Screen

Well, you won’t have much success if you just pepper customers with messages about how great your larger grill is or try to convince them that an existing grill is inferior. Why?

How will customers evolve when they have the right solution?\n  - Preference for a particular product: Multiple solutions to a JTBD can co-exist. It depends on the context of the struggle as to which one is right at which time.\n\n^ **both** push and pull need to work together to generate demand\n\n**Demand reduction**\n\n- Anxiety\n  - Anxiety in choice: We experience anxiety-in-choice when we don’t know if a product can help us get a Job Done. It exists only when we’ve never used a particular product before. For example, “I’ve never taken the bus to work. Is it ever on time? Where do I buy a ticket?”\n  - Anxiety in use: After customers use a product for a JTBD, the anxiety-in-choice largely disappears. Now their concerns are related to anxiety-in-use. For example, “I’ve taken the bus to work several times. But sometimes it’s late, and other times it’s early.

There is a huge potential for users to drop out and leave.\n\n- Understand what we need from our user to demonstrate value and for the product to work well. Money management example: needed to accomplish three goals:\n  - Collect some personal data\n  - Bank account access to auto pull in transactions\n  - Familiarise them with the product\n\n^ all of these are a **big ask**.\n\n- ‘incremental commitment' concept can be user here: ask for a low commitment to the product and then when the user gets something in return was ask for more.\n  - Build trust by demonstrating value before asking for more personal details (i.e. bank account access)\n  - Asking for what could be challenging data like the mobile phone number is much easier if we offer context and say what benefit there is to the user. \n  - We can then ask further questions, like email and for a password which will have less impact being asked later after we’ve shown value\n\n-------------\n\n**Things to avoid during onboarding**\n\n- Avoid the term registration, Registration is a meaningless concept, offer a reason for why you are asking for a pieces of information.\n\n- Similarly don’t ask too many questions, that might sound obvious, but the more you ask the more likely it is for users to drop out.\n\n- Answer these three simple questions when it comes to form fields:\n\n  - Why are you asking the question?\n\n  -  What will you use the data for?\n\n  -  What value does the user get from giving us this data?\n\n- Avoid Captcha; it is a big cause of dropouts as captchas can harm conversion rates. Plus, they aren’t very friendly.\n\n-------------\n\n**Applying this to YG**\n\n- what would YourGrocer's equivalents be in terms of what we need from the user in order to demonstrate value?\n  \n  - Collect some personal data (location, who are they, mobile, email)\n  \n  - Understand their delivery preferences (time slots available?)\n  \n  - Familiarise them with the product\n  \n  - Reduce / eliminate their anxiety and demonstrate them the entire product experience (get them to actually make an order / receive a delivery). (posit that only see full value when groceries actually arrive on the counter)\n\nWhat value would YG need to demonstrate?\n--> Annie: Quantify how many tantrums and meltdowns I've saved! (Does exist, but is behind the paywall)\n\n-------------\n\n**Adoption phase**\n\n- We need to support our users through the first few weeks and months of using our app. We need to give them a reason to come back to us.\n\n- The onboarding experience should think about this too. How are we re-engaging with the user? What online / offline channels do we have to do this?\n\n  - Email is the obvious one. This first email is super important. Reference article for insights on constructing it appropriately.\n  - YG: Has offline opportunities to follow up - through packaging / physical handouts / reference / top-ups etc. Think about these thoughtfully!\n\n- To get a user to adopt our service takes time. We need to be able to deliver useful content over a long period of time to encourage them to keep using the product.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbb48bb8b54a0771daac","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":7,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Mapping & understanding the customer lifecycle- Onboarding (trial & activation)","pos":131071,"shortLink":"GYEgBaME","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r985bmumzbs7ci14za+1l1dehn98j@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/GYEgBaME","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/GYEgBaME/7-mapping-understanding-the-customer-lifecycle-onboarding-trial-activation","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[{"bytes":null,"date":"2018-11-07T23:13:21.201Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","isUpload":false,"mimeType":"","name":"Onboarding users","previews":[],"url":"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/ux-lifecycle-activating-users/","pos":16384,"id":"5be37191fd903a3cff8be961"}],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be37738bac7e587e52f5bbc","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-12-06T02:38:40.825Z","desc":"> The first set of screens with which users interact, set the expectations of the app. To make sure your users don’t delete your app after the first use, you should teach them how to complete key tasks and make them want to come back for more.\n\n\n- EDUCATE USERS: First and foremost, the empty state screen should help users understand the context. Setting expectations for what'll happen makes users get comfortable. The best way to deliver this information is a show-or-tell format: show the user what the screen will look like when it's filled with content or tell them with a clear instructions.\n\n- Your primary goal is to persuade your users to do something as soon as possible so that the screen won't be empty. To prompt action on an empty state don't just show users the benefit they will receive when they interact with your app, but direct them to the desired action as well.\n\n- IF POSSIBLE, PROVIDE CONTENT THAT'S PERSONALIZED: When you personalize your app for users, you show off the value of your product even faster. The main goal of personalization is to deliver content that matches specific user needs or interests, with no effort from the targeted users\n\n- Think about 'success states' when the user has completed an important action or series of actions\n\n**--> Application to YG**\n\n- Review onboarding and review where empty states exist.

theory**\n\n> JTBD thinking is a principle, not a method. The study and application of prinicples, not methods, is what gives you the confidence to act in a complex world.\n\nJTBD thinking should be used to ground / reference the problems you are trying to solve, no matter the method you're using to try solve them\n\n> Upgrade your user, not your product. Don't build better cameras, build better photographers.\n\n^ ask yourself. How are we upgrading our user by doing this feature / initiative?\n\n^ How is feature / initiative delivering customers an ongoing feeling of emotional progress toward JTBD?\n\n**Applied to new features**\n\n- Before committing to develop a feature, make sure the problem intending to solve is one that customers actually have. To do so, find out if the customer had tried to solve the problem before.\n\n**Applied to competitive landscape**\n\n- What's the user's emotional motivation - use that to segment competition. Competitors will appeal to the same emotional aspiration (i.e. get me out of an entreprenurial slump with advice from someone I respect - conferences, linkedin, clarity)\n\n- From which budget will my product take away money? When they start using my produt, what will customers stop using?\n\n**On anxiety**\n\n- How does anxiety stop customers from buying a product? This should be viewed as a competitor.\n- Does the customer experience any anxiety in using the product? Find a way to make it less intimidating.\n\n\n**On habits**\n\n- Habits are a competitor to a product. Understand what habits users currently have, how can your product mimic / replace / enhance those whilst allowing the user to achieve progress.\n\n** on struggles**\n- Look for compensatory behaviour for examples of 'struggle' that can form product opportunities. i.e. are customers writing recipes on a list first? Using pinterest? Etc - user testing\n\n--------\n\n**Articulating a JTBD**\n\n- [Push, struggle, job] + [Pull, how life is better, jobs is done]\n--> Free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products

generation**\n\n- Push: When people change when they're not happy with the way things are.\n\n  - External Pushes: I.e.new life circumstance\n  - Internal pushes: Internal emotional motivation: i.e. struggling with frustration / anxiety / etc\n\n- Pull: \n  - Idea of a better life: To make progress. How will customers evolve when they have the right solution?\n  - Preference for a particular product: Multiple solutions to a JTBD can co-exist. It depends on the context of the struggle as to which one is right at which time.\n\n^ **both** push and pull need to work together to generate demand\n\n**Demand reduction**\n\n- Anxiety\n  - Anxiety in choice: We experience anxiety-in-choice when we don’t know if a product can help us get a Job Done. It exists only when we’ve never used a particular product before. For example, “I’ve never taken the bus to work. Is it ever on time? Where do I buy a ticket?”\n  - Anxiety in use: After customers use a product for a JTBD, the anxiety-in-choice largely disappears. Now their concerns are related to anxiety-in-use. For example, “I’ve taken the bus to work several times. But sometimes it’s late, and other times it’s early. I wish I knew its arrival time in advance.” In this case, we know a product can deliver progress, but certain qualities about it make us nervous about using it.\n\n- Intertia\n  - Habits in choice: The forces that exist at the moment of decision and prevent a customer from switching from one product to another.\n  - Habit in use: What disruptions in buying patterns exist as a consequence of an old habit?\n\n--> Solving for customers’ habits is often an easy win. Your prospective customer already knows about your product and wants to buy it but can’t switch because of some small habit holding him or her back. All you have to do is figure out what’s holding your customer back and solve it.\n\n--> Comparing the habits of your best customers with the havits of those who have recently quit is a great way to figure out how to turn swtichers into loyal customers. The first group have adapted to get their job done - learn from them and use those data to help those who are struggling.\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbbe33f7515969f9d6f8","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":16,"idAttachmentCover":"5be39bfbad0e5e624e650dec","locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"JTBD

We must abandon the idea that customers have a laundry list of “needs.” Instead, we should see customers as having only one need: to make progress within the systems they belong to. Any discomfort or frustrations they experience in making that progress should not be thought of as needs but rather descriptions of interactions between customers, their JTBD, and the product they’ve currently hired for their JTBD. For example, a car owner might claim that he “needs” more parking options in New York City. But is that really the problem? Or is the problem an expectation that it’s a good idea to own and drive a car in a population-dense area like New York City? Perhaps the best way to help this person make progress isn’t to solve the “needs” associated with owning a car; rather, it’s to make car ownership obsolete. At the time of this writing, this is the progress that products such as Uber and Lyft are trying to make happen.\n\n> increase profits by designing for the system, not for customers’ stated preferences.\n\n-----\n\n- It all comes down to four points: \n  - (1) all customers want to make progress within the systems they belong to; \n  - (2) customers, producers, innovators, and products are all parts of a system; \n  - (3) understanding the system comes from studying the interdependencies between the parts, not from studying the parts; and \n  - (4) each system is complex and one of a kind, so solutions that improve them must also be one of a kind.\n\n- Bring focus to which system of progress you're solving by splitting up products that deliver different types of progress.\n\n--> YG: Is mealkits a different system of progress in a different JTBD? Be careful\n\n^ instead, do we need to convince them of another system / JTBD?\n\n- Persuade customers to reject their current products by changing their JTBD. A great salesperson understands that customer “wants” come from the system, not the customer. So, if you want to change “what customers want,” all you have to do is convince them of a Job that is worth getting Done.\n\n- Imagine you make outdoor grills. You want to persuade customers to upgrade from small grills to larger, more expensive ones. How do you do that? Well, you won’t have much success if you just pepper customers with messages about how great your larger grill is or try to convince them that an existing grill is inferior. Why? These customers are fine with the way things are A healthy sync exists between their JTBD and the small grill they’ve hired for it.\n\n- Customers are making the kind of progress they want. However, you will have a shot at selling a larger grill if you can convince customers how rewarding it is to host a large party and grill food for everyone. If customers agree to that idea of progress, they realize that their current grills can’t get them there. In that moment, you’ve changed the customers’ JTBD and changed the system of progress they interact with. If they want to restore sync to the system, then they need a new solution. That’s when you pull the curtain back on the larger grill and casually point out that they can cook food for twenty people.\n\n\n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbbe33f7515969f9d6f8","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":17,"idAttachmentCover":"5be3ad0674adf757f6583c6b","locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"JTBD

The objective is not to test the functionality itself (that's QA), but to test the _experience_ within that functionality\n\n**Setting objectives**\n\n- What are you trying to learn?\n- What do I need to know from this session?\n\n--> then identify exactly which features and ares you want feedback on.\n\ni.e.\n\n- Find out whether users are able to complete specified tasks successfully (e.g. purchase a product, find information),\n- Identify how long it takes to complete specific tasks,\n- Find out whether users are satisfied with a product and identify changes required to improve satisfaction. \n\n-----\n\n**Setting tasks**\n\n- Make them realistic and actionable. i.e. specific parts of the product\n  - Getting set up on the product\n  - Completing a checkout\n\n--> Clearly describe the task to complete and make it easy. People become discouraged when tasks are unclear.\n\n- Have a goal for each task.\n  - \"I expect that users will be able to do X within two minutes\"\n\n- Limit the number of tasks (5 within a 60 minute session is about right)\n\n- Provide a **Scenario** not an instruction. i.e. \"you're looking for a new way to do X, show me how you'd go about this\"\n\n^ test the task yourself several times and work out appropriate questions to ask\n\n-----\n\n**Setting the framing appropriately**\n\n- \"we/re not testing you, we're testing our design - nothing you do or say is wrong\"\n- \"You won't hurt my feelings - I've just come onboard and didn't have anything to do with building this / designing it\"\n- Start with easy tasks - they won't yield juicy insights but will get people talking and help relax them.\n- Ask them to narrate aloud","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbbe33f7515969f9d6f8","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":53,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Usability

Your product strategy is the bridge that connects your high-level vision to the specifics of your roadmap. And for many companies, the product strategy is the main contributor to their overall business strategy. This makes it crucial that you use product strategy as a starting place for your roadmap.\n\n------\n\n##Derives from company mission / vision / values\n\n**Mission Defines Your Intent **\n\nA mission is not what you value, nor is it a vision for the future; it’s the intent you hold right now and the purpose driving you to realize your vision. A well-written mission statement will clarify your business’s intentions.\n\n**Vision Is the Outcome You Seek**\n\n A company vision should be about a longer-term outcome that has an impact on the lives of the people your product serves, as well as on your organization. Vision is why your organization exists, and it can be decomposed into the benefits you hope to create through your efforts — for both the world and your organization.\n\n**Values Are Beliefs and Ideals**\n\n Values are also intended to guide behaviors. Values shape that ambiguous word thrown around company HR departments, culture — how people behave when no one is watching. Your organization’s values may inform your vision or mission, and how you go about achieving it.\n\n-----\n\n**Product vision - why your product exists**\n\n- Clarifies why you are bringing a product to market in the first place and what its success will mean to the world and the organisation\n\n\n_Value proposition template_\n\nFor: [target customer] \nWho: [target customer’s needs] \nThe: [product name] \nIs a: [product category] \nThat: [product benefit/reason to buy] \nUnlike: [competitors] \nOur product: [differentiation] \nSupports our: [objective(s)]\n\n> For homeowner landscape enthusiasts Who need a reliable hose that’s survives repeated use The Wombat Garden Hose Is a water delivery system That offers a reliable operation under any conditions Unlike the competition The Wombat Garden Hose is indestructible and offers uninterrupted wated delivery.\n\nThen pare down to:\n\n\"A world where the [target customer] no longer suffers from the [identified problem] because of [product] they [benefit]\"\n\n>A world where American landscape enthusiasts [target customer] can have a more predictable and automatic [identified problem] watering system that can perfect their lawns [benefit] with an effective water delivery system [product].\n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":29,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Defining a product vision","pos":327679,"shortLink":"M3ztC2I4","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r9nm28ahyorl98r8d0+1j7tum5ak5@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/M3ztC2I4","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/M3ztC2I4/29-defining-a-product-vision","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be646bac8cb730e376a2054","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-11-12T05:01:08.531Z","desc":"> Identifying business objectives that tie to your vision is critical to making that vision a reality. If you don't have speciific objectives to hit along the way, the vision will be challenging to implement - there will be too many different directions to take to get there.\n\n------\n\nOKRs are a great way to pair business objectives with success criteria.\n\n**Objectives** are specific qualitative goals\n\n**Key results** are quantitative measures of progress toward achieveing those objectives.\n\n- **Everything on your roadmap must be tied to at least one of your objectives**\n  - In practice, where OKRs are set quarterly, the Roadmap should be refreshed quarterly to reflect this, re-prioritised and updated with respect to the product circle's quarterly OKRs\n- Stick to a manageable number of objectives. Less than 5 seems most effective\n- Focus on outcomes, not output\n\n-----\n\n**Contactually Objectives example**\n\nIt expresses its product strategy for the next year in three objectives, each with measurable success criteria: \n\n- “launch new features or services that realtors will pay more money for,”\n- “improve the feature sets of our existing plans so more users will purchase,”\n- “improve our team functionality to better meet the needs of team leads.”\n\nEach of these themes is tied to an objective that can then be measured by specific key results, and their roadmap reflects this. This internal objectives-driven approach to roadmapping makes direction crystal-clear for internal teams. In this case, rather than being based on customer needs, each objective focuses on a measurable business benefit that work is designed to achieve\n\n-----\n\n*Key Results (and metrics)**\n\n- Sometimes you might only have one metric per objective. That's ok. \n- Starting with a handful of KPIs (AKA key results) is a good and manageable place to land.\n\n-----\n\n**Contactually key results example**\n\nTying this back to Contactually’s objective of **“improve the feature sets of our existing plans so more users will purchase,”**\n\nkey results here could be \n\n- “an increase in user base by 5% over the course of a specific timeframe” (a quarter, year, etc.) \n\nand feature-specific metrics such as \n\n- “time to compose and send an email is reduced by 10%,” indicating that the usability of that part of the product has been improved. \n\n_Note that there can be multiple key results to each objective, as it may take different measures to determine whether an objective is met._\n\n--------\n\n**Caution on metrics**\n\n- Be aware of falling into the trap of measuring non-business metrics. i.e.:\n\n  - Feature metrics: Performance of a feature (How many people are using it? Is it quicker or easier for a customer to do X now than it was before?)\n\n  - Product metrics: Performance of specific product objectives (Because of feature X, more people are using functionality Y)\n\n  - Team metrics : How many story points/features were launched at the end of the month/quarter? (I put this in for dramatic effect; this will only lead to — at best — success theatre, and at worse, the wrong behaviours from all parties)\n\n^ these measures tell us very little about the business impact of all the work we've done. **Attached images** display a better example of tying key results to business objectives\n\nHEART framework is good for setting metrics:

A theme simply represents a bigger user or business problem you want to discover a solution (aka Epic) for in order to reach your goals.\n\nExamples for a theme could be things like 'User Growth', 'Revenue', 'Churn' or 'Enterprise'. Corresponding epics could then be 'Referral Mechanism', 'Free Trial' or 'Single Sign On'.\n\n------\n\n**Themes must be tied back to objectives**\n\nIf any theme on your roadmap does not map back to an objective, this should be a warning sign. EVERY theme on your roadmap should related to at least one objective. If not, review the theme to see if it should be in the roadmap at all. \n\n- Helps you stay focused on the right things and avoid distraction.\n- Your objectives help you realise your product vision and your themes and subthemes help you accomplish your objectives.\n- It's fine if a theme informs multiple goals\n- One way to link themes to objetives is to color code your objectives and then tag themes with the assoviated colour.\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":33,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Themes and sub-themes on a roadmap","pos":589823,"shortLink":"5NYNlkPB","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r9nr3rgn5sqk76f9mi+2p6tuu5vo1@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/5NYNlkPB","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/5NYNlkPB/33-themes-and-sub-themes-on-a-roadmap","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be64f4f78e67341ad01e8ee","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-11-10T04:33:16.804Z","desc":"- Every time you plan a big update to the roadmap, you should review and reconsider the objectives. \n- If your roadmap is laid out in quarters, you should probably revist it and update it every quarter","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbcb11694c72bf842f09","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":34,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Reviewing and updating a roadmap","pos":655359,"shortLink":"9XtJZNiK","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r9ntpzbgcrjngnuwvi+14wro2d3us@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/9XtJZNiK","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/9XtJZNiK/34-reviewing-and-updating-a-roadmap","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be65a38e38dbc887ee7d89d","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-11-10T04:11:54.330Z","desc":"> by giving each stakeholder the opportunity to have input early on (i.e., while the product roadmap is still a work in progress), the shuttle diplomacy process gives them authorship of the plan too.

a method for prioritisation\n\nA method for categorising your prioritised list of requirements into un-ambiguous buckets, making it clear what your release criteria are. Informs what should be cut first in a sprint where scope cuts are required\n\n-----\n\nCould-haves are features that are wanted, but not as important as should-haves. These are the first items you would cut if they introduced budget or deadline risk. You can distinguish could-haves from should-haves by the degree of pain that leaving them out would cause the customer, or the reduction in value of the solution. Another way some teams think of this category is as a list things to include “if easy.” Your delighters may also fall into this bucket. \n\nWon’t-haves are requirements deemed “out of scope” for a particular release. Won’t-haves could contain both satisfiers and delighters, but should not contain dissatisfiers or critical path items (otherwise, what’s the point of releasing?). Won’t-haves may be included in future releases, of course.

The Job Story describes a struggling moment which the customer faces, how they visualize progress, and how life is better when they have a solution for that struggling moment.\n\n>User stories and specs don’t do any of that. They describe what the solution looks like.\n\n## [ A moment of frustration ] + [ how progress is visualized ] + [ how life is better ]\n\n^ All of the information above is critical and very informative because we’re focusing on causality. Each job story should provide as much context as possible and focus on motivation… instead of just implementation... Also, we’re describing the emotions surrouding a situation, and how things would be different once that situation is resolved.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n**Problem with user stories**: The first problem is that we start with a Persona, which is a very bad idea, and then plop in an action which we think should be taken in order to achieve the expected outcome\n\n**Good things about job stories**: Job Stories are great because it makes you think about motivation and context and de-emphasizes adding any particular implementation. Often, because people are so focused on the who and how, they totally miss the why. When you start to understand the why, your mind is then open to think of creative and original ways to solve the problem.\n\n------\n\nExample:\n\nWhen I’m presenting my visual design and I’m worried that people will reject its merits, I want something objective to back it up, so that people will see and discuss the design with less subjective bias.\n\n----\n\n**Testing out with YG cards**\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/HCFiYVLt/756-as-a-piedis-picker-i-need-to-know-which-orders-have-already-been-printed\n\nWhen I'm printing orders and I've got a lot to get through, I want to know I'm not printing one that's already been fulfilled so I'm confident I'm not doing re-work or doubling up on orders.\n\nAcceptance:\n- \n ","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbe1fe10e819c2223922","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":18,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Job stories > user stories","pos":65535,"shortLink":"6DqhTfkZ","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":true,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r99ogo5knvazqtc43e+1vi6vj81eq@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":["5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f"],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/6DqhTfkZ","start":null,"subscribed":true,"url":"https://trello.com/c/6DqhTfkZ/18-job-stories-user-stories","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[{"bytes":null,"date":"2018-11-08T04:24:32.863Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","isUpload":false,"mimeType":"","name":"reference article","previews":[],"url":"https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27","pos":16384,"id":"5be3ba808a11964655c9f25e"}],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be3c6927b31236fb0499be1","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-11-08T05:16:02.253Z","desc":"","descData":null,"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"5be2bbe1fe10e819c2223922","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":21,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"To research: How to go from Product Roadmap, to Product backlog, to Sprints","pos":131071,"shortLink":"WZneEomG","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":false,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2r99yudor3nq407sqg1+0rh3tdx32o@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/WZneEomG","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/WZneEomG/21-to-research-how-to-go-from-product-roadmap-to-product-backlog-to-sprints","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"5be4c530f859390fad35f9f4","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2018-11-09T03:55:49.546Z","desc":"**Heirarchy of terms**\n\n- A release can contain multiple sprints.\n  - Sprints AKA 'iterations'\n  - Sprints usually last two to four weeks\n  - Whether or not each sprint is released at completion, it should still potentially be shippable (functional and tested)\n  - A sprint has four distinct phases (Planning, development, review retrospective.\n    - Planning: Product backlog items selected, goal of iteration defined\n    - Development: Definition, coding and automated + functional testing. Standups\n    - Review: meeting with stakeholders to demo and get feedback\n    - Retro - process improvement\n- a 'Product backlog' is a prioritised set of features / job stories that are placed into iterations.\n  - A product backlog should map the product vision and strategic goals of the company\n  - As stories move towards the top of the product backlog, the product owner (me) adds more detail and the development team estiamtes the work involved.\n\nQuestions for YG:\n- What is your release cycle?\n- What is your sprint length?\n\n**Sprint planning meetings**\n\n1. First is to decide what to build:\n  - Review product vision and progress since last sprint\n  - Discuss priority of backlog (should already have been socialised for feedback)\n  - Opporrtunity to 'groom' the backlog - reorganise it etc.\n  - Setting sprint goal\n\n2. Second is how to build it.\n  - Team compiles a list of tasks to achieve the backlog items and meet the sprint goal. \n  - Each task should be smallish - 4-16 hours of work. Task list = Sprint backlog.\n  - Example product backog item --> sprint backlog task: \"Create API layer to access purchase data\" --> \"Map purchase data elements to database tables\" + \"\" etc\n\n**Release management**\n\n- Roadmap should be divided into releases\n- Poduct backlog of features (job stories) created which define each release\n- With devs, separate the upcoming release into a series of sprints. The tasks are assembled in the sprint backlog\n- Sometimes teams need to do research in order to size a story. In this case, create a research story, with a time limit and included as work to be done in the release.

management across iterations**\nSimultaneously:\n\n- Gathering feedback on recently released iterations\n- Supporting the development team on the current iteration\n- Fleshing out requirements by speaking with customers, **testing concepts and developing prototypes** for upcoming releases.\n\n--> A good guide is to focus on 120 days of the product cycle.\n\n--------\n\n1. For Sprint T + 2, or sixty days out, gather feedback from customers about what the next features should be and how the product should behave. You might research a design goal, such as identifying obstacles that prevent prospects from converting to customers on your website. You should also socialize these requirements with development to capture their questions and concerns that need to be answered.\n\n2. For Sprint T + 1, or thirty days out, validate designs, capture full acceptance criteria for each requirement, and complete each of the user stories so that they can be properly sized and developed. \n\n3. For the current Sprint, support your development team by answering any questions that they have as they go through the development process. \n\n4. For the Sprint that has just been released, validate the actual working software with customers to uncover any changes needed for future iterations. \n\n-------\n\nit is a good idea to have a few evergreen requirements. These are features that have to be developed but are not currently urgent. Further, they are technically difficult but require little or no input from the product management team (architectural changes, performance enhancements, and scalability improvements, etc.) This way, if for any reason your research on a requirement becomes delayed, you can at least slot an evergreen feature into the iteration and ensure the team remains productive addressing high value items.\n\n-------\n\nManaging design in Agile:\n\nDesigners can form part of the development team - in which case the UXer owns the first phase of the development process for stories that touch the UI. The UXer will work on current stories that do not require significant user validation and will look ahead to upcoming iterations for projects with longer lead times.\n\n-------\n\n**^ Managing at YG**. Contract designer at commencement of each sprint? Work on validated product backlog items that have been accepted? UI tasks.\n-- PM work (me) on validating feature sets with prototyping, wireframing, discovery (i.e. an onboarding flow).\n\n^^ **Use case** : User-onboarding flow.\n\n- PM: Sprint T+2 - gather feedback from customers / research / discover anxieties / habits / goal etc **Research a design goal**\n- PM: Sprint T+1 - Prototype / validate designs, capture acceptance criteria annd job stories for sizing and development\n- PM:  Current sprint: manage process\n- Design: Current sprint: Take validated designs and build out User interface designs at commencement of sprint.

does it work?\n\n- Understand where you are (the current condition),\n- where you want to be (target condition),\n- whats stopping you from making progress towards it (obstacle),\n- whats your next step,\n- what do think will happen (expected),\n- what did you learn.\n\n------\n\nExample:\n\nConsider this as the current condition — 85% of trial users don’t complete key activation steps.\n\nWe don’t know why yet, but we do know that we need to achieve a rate of at least 50% to have a healthy trial to subscribing rate and then retention rate thereafter.\n\nIt is here the Kata gives us a simple framework to progress through what we don’t know to discover potential solutions, then to communicate the findings and progress.\n\nIn this example below, each row might be a week or shorter depending on the problem space.\n\n(see attached image)\n\nThe process is about progressively solving problems, identifying the next step, and expanding understanding. Once there is sufficient understanding to anchor knowledge and take the next step, do so. Step and repeat. \n\nThis framework will deepen your customer knowledge and expose a host of opportunities and solutions to impact the business objective.\n\n-----\n\nIn first image attached, we linked the business objective to increasing the adoption of feature X, making a single bet about what would have the desired business impact. \n\nWithout using a method of discovery like the Product Kata, this is more of a hunch. That’s not to say hunches are bad, but before we go spending the company’s money we should make sure we have properly explored the problem space.\n\nIn the Kata, we observed multiple things that contributed to the desired business objective. Now, if only there was a way to visualise the Product Kata and visualise the exploration of the problem space…\n\nThis segues into another neat tool: opportunity solution trees. This tool allows the team to create a mental representation of how the business objective could be achieved, while making the guesses/assumptions obvious.\n\n-----\nregarding the image:\n\n- Blue: Good product discovery starts with a clear desired business outcome. For us this is defined in the OKRs for our team, as set against the agreed business objective.\n\n- Green: Opportunities should emerge from generative research. From research performed as part of the Kata such as user interviews, surveys, feedback and the like, we produce opportunities worth exploring.\n\n- Yellow: Solutions can and should come from everywhere (as long as they are bounded by an opportunity). Grouped together by opportunities, we can generate ideas that would have impact.\n\n- Orange: Experiment to evaluate and evolve your solutions Lastly, rather than fully commit to a solutions feature set, we can experiment our way towards it. It’s here we combine with the Kata (Obstacles and Steps) and use the experiments as steps towards the target condition/business objective.\n\n-----\n\n**note** : The decision trees can also be used in reverse; if you have a lot of ideas (or a backlog you’ve just taken over), you can work backwards to the objective and discard ideas that don’t align.\n\n> Use opportunity solutions trees to foster and visualise multi-tracking and experimentation, and to avoid single idea bets. Importantly, use as communication tool for the business and peers to explain thinking.\n\n^ [Read this](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/) for

the right thing, then check if it worked**\n\nWe need to define the measurement of success at multiple levels. First, at the desired business objective, then at the opportunity, and finally at the solution level. For each one-pager the success metrics should be defined; I suggest using the HEART framework and picking the 2 relevant metrics for the solution.\n\nHEART framework: https://www.dtelepathy.com/ux-metrics/#intro\n\nHowever, the measurement of the solution is not enough. We need to be looking at the impact to the business metric, which we record in the Result field. Obviously, this will lag after release, so we should set a timeframe to define if the solution worked or not and record it. This should be reviewed as part of the PM team. This might be painful to begin with; but ultimately will improve your product thinking and

Assumption tests (site below the solution space) _How we'll evaluate which solutions will help us best create customer value in a way that drives business value_\n\nThe opportunity space can and should consist of multiple layers of opportunities, i.e. smaller ones that when taken together end up solving larger opportunities. The OST helps teams take large, project size opportunities and break them down. As you work your way vertically down the tree, the opportunities get smaller. Teams can then simply focus on one opportunity at a time. With time, as we address these smaller opportunities, these solutions begin to address the larger opportunities.\n\n------\n\n> “The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performance.”\n\nJonassen argues that ill-structured problems are problems that have many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. The solver must start by defining the goal and constraints of the problem before exploring potential solutions.\n\nThe short of it is that the problem solver, in our case, the product manager (or even better, the product team), must start by framing the problem.\n\n**Multitracking in a systematic way.**\n\nHis first question, “What would you have if you had that?” creates a structure between “I want a house” and “I want to feel grounded in my community.”\n\nHis second question, “How else can you feel grounded in your community?”, expands that structure.\n\n----\n\nLet’s use a product example to illustrate this. Imagine you work at Facebook and you are responsible for newsfeed stories.\n\nYou might answer the question, “What should we build next?” with an idea, “Let’s add a dislike button.”\n\nSome of us rush off and build that first idea or two. That’s akin to rushing off and buying a house before examining why we want one.\n\nWe don’t multitrack in a systematic way.\n\nBy jumping straight to solutions, even when we do consider multiple options, we often compare solutions that shouldn’t be compared against each other.\n\n----\n\nInstead, we want to consider which problem each solution solves... and make a decision about which problem is a more valuable opportunity relative to the business goal..... From there, we only compare solutions that deliver on the same opportunities. \"Of these solutions, which is most likely to delivery on the target opportunity?\"\n\nA systematic approach requires that we consider multiple solutions that deliver on the same opportunity.\n\nBuilding an opportunity / solution tree, allows us to visualise and externalise our thinking, examine our thinking, and it allows others to critique our thinking. **This can act as our 'roadmap' in many ways** it's flexible enough to not commit us to anything\n\n----\n\n**Steps to building out our Opp / Solution trees**\n\n1) Start with a clear desired outcome\n\n- i.e. start with a Key Result from ORKs\n- It's often easier to create separate trees for each goal or metric. \n\n_For us, it could be: Reach profitability in 6 months, or retain our Conversion to engaged member metric_\n\n2) Gather opportunities that emerge from generative research\n\n- To start, capture what you think the opportunities are in your problem space.  Then quickly refine these with generative research. \n\n3) Gather solutions, from everywhere, but only solutions that connect to an opportunity\n\n- solutions should only be considered if they help us deliver on one of our target opportunities. If they don’t connect to the tree, they should be considered a distraction.\n\n4) Experiment to evaluate\n\n- Expermints reflect work to test riskiest assumptions behind a solution, not your whole solution. \n\n---\n\n**A Framework for Continuous Product Discovery**\n\n\n- The goal isn’t to first discover opportunities and then discover solutions. Instead, we want to be continuously doing both.\n- Every week you want to be doing some activities that support discovering and refining new opportunities \n- and every week you want to be doing some activities that support discovering and refining solutions.\n- And, of course, every week you want to be delivering value to your customer.\n\nNobody said dual-track was easy. But it does lead to better products. And isn’t that what we all want?\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":57,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Opportunity / Solution trees","pos":655359,"shortLink":"rdXr0PFP","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":1,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2rn1qef8x8yadn4wm5d+0yh8emvo5t@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/rdXr0PFP","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/rdXr0PFP/57-opportunity-solution-trees","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[{"bytes":null,"date":"2019-01-16T00:30:27.147Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","isUpload":false,"mimeType":"","name":"Source","previews":[],"url":"https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/","pos":16384,"id":"5c3e7b231b9c1277fde6afe6"}],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"614d77e50f7b33448e7fa765","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-09-24T07:05:38.315Z","desc":"Instead of asking: \"Should we solve this customer need\" with OSTs we ask \"Which of these customer needs is most important for us to address next?\"\n\nInstead of falling in love with our first idea(s), we'll ask: \"what else could we build\"? or \"How else could we address this opportunity\"?","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":146,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Compare & Contrast Decisions in place of whether or not decisions","pos":720895,"shortLink":"gTik7kBT","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2x3risti60motrmgg2t+2omvrkb8t4@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/gTik7kBT","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/gTik7kBT/146-compare-contrast-decisions-in-place-of-whether-or-not-decisions","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"614d7900cdc2536b5a7f1b08","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-09-24T07:08:30.496Z","desc":"The best designers do this.

maps are a great starting point to document current knowledge. They should first be completed individually by the product trio and then combined into a more holistic view of the current state of knowledge. Starting individually is important as it helps prevent group think by giving each member an opportunity to develop their own perspective.\n\nThis is treated only as a series of hunches and possibilities, not the truth, but it gives a clear starting point. You make explicit what you think you know, where there are open questions, and what needs vetting in upcoming interviews with customers.\n\nThis artefact helps you explore your own, and your team-mates' perspectives and it guides customer interviews. It helps give structure to the opportunity space and is refined week on week as you learn more.\n\n---\n\n**Setting the scope of an experience map**\n\nThis is an important first step. The scope should be in relation to the outcome you're looking for. If you're focused on a traction metric, due to having high confidence about a specific area / opportunity, then you might set the scope quite narrow - understand how users entertain themselves with our service.\n\nIn most cases however, you'll want a scope that gives you room to explore, whilst also staying focused on your desired outcome. I.e. \"how do customers entertain themselves with video\"....\n\nA vend example could be: \"What's preventing retail store owners from keeping their online store current & up-to-date?\"\n\n---\n\n**Experience maps can start as a 6P story**\n\n- It focuses on the story around the interactions with the product, not the product itself. It draws the experiences of the customer.\n\n**But they develop into more detailed and specific maps as we learn**\n\n- As we learn more about customer, we'll add a lot more detail to the map - i.e. the various different ways they can hear about our product, the various other products they interact with on the way to solving their problem, etc.\n\n---\n\n**Combining individual maps into a collective with nodes and links**\n\n**Nodes**: Actions or points in time in the experience\n**Links**: What connect the nodes together\n\n1. Arrange all nodes from individual maps into one collective map\n2. Collapse similar / duplicate nodes together (careful not to over-generalise to lose important detail / context)\n3. Determine the links between each node. The good, the bad, those that loop back, where people give up, etc. Motivation + Ability mapping framework might play nicely here\n4.

We develop story questions to elicit this knowledge... the scope of the story you want to elicit will change throughout the discovery process, i.e.:\n\n####Narrow - for optimising your existing product\n\n- **Tell us about the last time you used our streaming service**: Elicit pain points, needs, desires with your product\n\nvs\n\n####Broader - to uncover new opportunities\n\n- **Tell us about the last time you watched any streaming service**: Elicit opportunities around your product and also competitors\n\n\nvs\n\n####Broadest - might help you uncover new markets\n\n- **Tell us about the last time you were entertained **: Elicit opportunities regarding many different forms of entertainment and uncovers info about what other things your product category is competing with\n\n\n-----\n\nTip: Use the experience map you created to provide timeline prompts to customers you're interviewing. Also draw out a version of their timeline as they talk so you can refer back to it. Ask about nodes that they left out in their story.\n\n(Page 81-83)","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":163,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Research Questions & Interview Questions","pos":1703935,"shortLink":"TGStunwI","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2x3xew7sndkbabxq7fr+1f4776yorn@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/TGStunwI","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/TGStunwI/163-research-questions-interview-questions","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"614e8fac00a73f7a8bf580b8","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-09-25T02:57:36.800Z","desc":"","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":164,"idAttachmentCover":"614e901fa3aff30d8d9debe5","locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Note: Avoiding cognitive bias.

opportunities is crucial, but it can be difficult to prioritse a flat list of opportunities, given they all come in different shapes and sizes. Equally, some are interrelated, while some are sub-sets of others.\n\nFor example:\n- I can't find anything to watch\n- I'm out of episodes of my favourite show.\n\n\"I'm out of episodes\" is one reason someone can't find anything to watch, but not the only. It's therefore a sub-opportunity of a bigger opportunity.\n\nAlso:\n- I want to watch on the plane\n- I want to watch on a train\n\nThese could be a sub-set of 'I want to watch on the go'. They could be collapsed into a single opportunity, unless the contexts provided different constraints such as _no internet on a plane_ whereas there may be cell data on the train. So perhaps they should be distinct sub-opportunities.\n\nStructuring before prioristsing can help address common conernscs like:\n- Should we always prioritise easy problems over hard?\n- If so, do we ever get to the hard problems that may have the potential to differentiate us from our competitors and really drive our outcomes?\n\nStructuring trees with parent & sibling relationships helps us deconstruct large, intractable problems into a series of smaller more solvable problems, for example 'is this show any good' might on the surface look like a challenging problem to solve, but as we dig in, we learn different people solve this problem in different ways:\n- Who is in it?\n- Is this similar to other shows I've watched?\n- Who else is watching this show?\n- What type of show is this?\n\n----\n\nIf you identify two opportunities that are siblings, look for a parent opportunity. The parent opp may not have been explicitly mentioned in an interview, and that's fine. Add it as it is implied by the other two opportunities.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"614d6da5d490a965d6c5410f","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":172,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"OST structure: Parents & Siblings","pos":2228223,"shortLink":"TvhkvJot","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2x4bfjlbixd2wtby5k0+1drxo4i29o@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/TvhkvJot","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/TvhkvJot/172-ost-structure-parents-siblings","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"61511f9f1dcf7a6d956318c7","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-09-27T01:39:37.587Z","desc":"We need each opportunity to be distinct from every other opportunity.

Check everyone is excited about at least one of these ideas.\n\n**The goal at this point is to set up a good compare and contrast decision: Which of these ideas best delivers on our target opportunity?**\n\nWe'll go about answering that question with prototyping and assumption testing.

Diversity is useful.\n\n#### If started, share your story maps and assumption lists\n\n- Ask them to add to the assumptions list, this is where their different perspective and expertise can help catch out your blind spots.\n- Ask them if they would have prioritised the assumptions differently.

2-3 months of time to ramp up, assuming 2-3 hours per day is being spent on it.\n\n#### Customer & User Knowledge\n\nBeyond visiting customers….\n\n\n- Your team (engineering & design leads)\n- Start with the user research team, if there is one\n- Then the customer success / service team\n  - Learn who their fav customers are, their least fav, and why\n  - Understand more about how customers perceive your product.\n  - Learn what they can teach you about your users and customers\n- Product Marketing has a valuable perspective on users and also good insights into the broader sales and marketing divisions and who you should talk to in there\n- Founders / CEO\n  - Which customers they consider the most helpful for you to truly get to know and understand. Not just happy, but unhappy too… you’re after as many perspectives as you can get.\n- At this point you’re able to go out and meeting real users and customers.\n  - Marty recommends at least 15 customer visits as part of new PM onboarding.\n\n####Data knowledge\n\nUser analytics: How users interact with your product\nSales analytics: The sales cycle for your product\nData warehouse analytics: How this data is changing over time\n\n_The idea is to attain competence with each of these tools which means two things:_\n\n- You know how to answer questions with that tool\n- You need to understand what the data in the tool is trying to tell you.\n\n####Industry and domain knowledge\n\nKey to industry knowledge is identifying which industry trends are expected to be relevant to the pM’s product.\n\n- The first step is to identify the trends, and there may be some education needed to understand what the trend or technology enables and what the capabilities and limitations may be.\n- Also included is competitive analysis. Product marketing is a good place to get started, but the PM will need to have a deeper understanding of the offerings, vision and strategy of each of the major players in the landscape\n  - Marty’s approach is to ask the PM to evaluate the top three to give players in the pace and write up a narrative comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of each player - i.e. highlighting opportunities\n\n#### Business and Company knowledge\n\nAn essential difference between competent and incompetent PMs.\n\n- Have the new PM fill out a business model canvas for their product. It is a quick and easy way to help the PM quickly realise the areas they might not understand.\n\n#### Sales & Marketing - Go-to-market\n\nThe go-to-market strategy describes how our product makes it into the hands of users and customers. It applies to every product.\n\nI.e. direct sales force, resellers, directly over the web. Etc.\n\nThe sales process starts with marketing which itself has many different strategies and techniques. Ultimately there is always some type of funnel starting with people becoming aware you exist, and hopefully through to active customer.\n\n- The new PM needs to understand the entire funnel from awareness, to trials and to onboarding.\n- It’s especially important to understand the capabilities and limitations of the sales channel. \n\n####Finance - Revenue and costs.\n\n- Marty advocates making a friend in finance for this purpose. There are financial related KPIs for every product and you need to understand:\n  - What those KPIs are (e.g. lifetime value of the customer\n  - What they mean \n  - Where your product stands… e.g. is lifetime value sufficient compared to your CAC (LTV / CAC)\n\n####Privacy and Compliance \n\nPrivacy, security, compliance, ethics. Make a friend in legal who can help the new PM understand legal constraints.\n\n####Biz dev & partnerships\n\nAgreements with tech partners, marketing partners etc, usually come along with constraints about what we can do, it’s important to understand these.\n\n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"615bb71a42f7f805b0fa1359","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":232,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Acquiring Product Knowledge (An onboarding plan of sorts)","pos":16384,"shortLink":"zzOSC2Ao","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2x5xfrfyhm1c88eiged+0q7xb9xqyp@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/zzOSC2Ao","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/zzOSC2Ao/232-acquiring-product-knowledge-an-onboarding-plan-of-sorts","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"615bce31819b371a7464238f","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-10-05T04:04:02.016Z","desc":"","descData":{"emoji":{}},"dueReminder":null,"idBoard":"5be2bbad74bf314006e560b2","idLabels":[],"idList":"615bb71a42f7f805b0fa1359","idMembersVoted":[],"idShort":233,"idAttachmentCover":null,"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"self Assessment for growth","pos":32768,"shortLink":"nRdTuviu","isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":2,"description":false,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"dueComplete":false,"due":null,"email":"mattmjohnson+2nlpbvulic52tpmcosv+2x5xx8z6s1uvx2gb7nz+0hoa8gbwdt@boards.trello.com","idChecklists":[],"idMembers":[],"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":450}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":63}}},"shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/nRdTuviu","start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/nRdTuviu/233-self-assessment-for-growth","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"attachments":[{"bytes":1283666,"date":"2021-10-05T04:02:25.188Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","isUpload":true,"mimeType":"application/pdf","name":"Scanned Document 2021-10-05 at 3:02:19 pm.pdf","previews":[],"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/615bce31819b371a7464238f/attachments/615bce51664db383fdad6f78/download/Scanned_Document_2021-10-05_at_3_02_19_pm.pdf","pos":16384,"fileName":"Scanned_Document_2021-10-05_at_3_02_19_pm.pdf","id":"615bce51664db383fdad6f78"},{"bytes":3856665,"date":"2021-10-05T04:04:01.676Z","edgeColor":null,"idMember":"5881988dd015b7aeaf0d328f","isUpload":true,"mimeType":"application/pdf","name":"Scanned Document 2021-10-05 at 3:03:51 pm.pdf","previews":[],"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/615bce31819b371a7464238f/attachments/615bceb1feaed54e514ccf56/download/Scanned_Document_2021-10-05_at_3_03_51_pm.pdf","pos":32768,"fileName":"Scanned_Document_2021-10-05_at_3_03_51_pm.pdf","id":"615bceb1feaed54e514ccf56"}],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"615bd0d467e07389caef5534","address":null,"checkItemStates":null,"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dateLastActivity":"2021-10-05T10:59:03.898Z","desc":"Could be used in conjunction with approach outlined here: https://trello.com/c/7xNTQXmw\n\n——\n\nThis is a roughly 6-page document which describes in narrative form the problem you’re trying to solve, why this will be valuable for your customers and for your business, and your strategy for solving the problem.\n\nThis approach will help point out blind spots in your process, it will help you anticipate and resolve questions from stakeholders before making a presentation, etc.\n\n——\n\nThe structure is to write the narrative itself in a few pages and then follow this with an FAQ.
